			<b> Teaching Assistant Positions</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I am currently a teaching assistant for a graduate level course, Networks Security. Previously,
				I have been teaching assistant for four undergraduate courses; 2x Data Structures, Introduction 
				to Programming and Operating Systems.

			<b> Tiny EPC</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have developed an EPC for testing various load-balancing algorithms for cellular networks. 
				The EPC, written in Golang, provides flexibility to tune various EPC related parameters so that
				it can be used effectively for simulating any load balancing algorithms.

			<b> Khata Mobile Application | JS | React-Native | Team Work</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an android mobile application which can be used for maintaining daily balance logs. Users can credit or debit virtual money to each other by this application and the application will maintain all record which will be used accordingly when peers make transactions next time. In this project, the aim was to go through a complete software engineering process required for creating a software, invloving Requirements Gathering, SDS, Testing etc. I have done this project in a <a href = "https://github.com/abdul-manaan/Khata/graphs/contributors">team</a> with four other active contributors.

			<b> Half-Hulk Chrome Browser Extension | JS | Chrome API</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an extension for chrome browser which insures that other installed browser extensions are not causing any security or privacy related issues, like user's data stealing, while performing their network activities. It watches actions of other extensions in asynchronous mode and triggers a scan when any suspecious activity seems to occur. I developed it after motivation from a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/node/184486">research paper </a> published by UC Berkeley.
