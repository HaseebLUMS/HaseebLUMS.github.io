			<b> JSModel: Analyzing and Categorizing JavaScript in Today's Web Using Machine Learning</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				In this paper, we present JSModel, a novel machine learning based
				approach to classifiy JS code present in the web-pages with a high re-
				call and precision. We analyze JavaScript elements from a real-world
				data-set and classifying them into 15 different JS categories. The
				fine-grained analysis results along with our detailed methodology
				of building the vocabulary and vectors for the Machine Learning
				models are presented in our work. JSModel classification can be
				used to simplify complex web pages and decrease overall page load
				time and improve the websitesâ€™ performance. The paper is submitted in 
				ACM Sigmetrics 2020 and I am the primary author of this research paper.

			<b> Using Application Layer Banner Data to Automatically Identify IoT Devices</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				This is an accepted Sigcomm CCR 2020's paper. In this paper, 
				we claim that a work from Usenix on automatic identification of IoT devices
				is not an efficient procedure and resuts in ~19% accuracy on real world data-set which 
				is significantly lower than the reported in Usenix's paper. I am a second author in 
				this paper and I started this work upon securing a grant from Lahore University
				of Management Sciences (LUMS). Previously, a poster related to this work was also accepted
				in IMC Reproducibility Track 2019.

			<b> Teaching Assistant Positions</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I am currently a teaching assistant for a graduate level course, Networks Security. Previously,
				I have been teaching assistant for four undergraduate courses; 2x Data Structures, Introduction 
				to Programming and Operating Systems.

			<b> Tiny EPC</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have developed an EPC for testing various load-balancing algorithms for cellular networks. 
				The EPC, written in Golang, provides flexibility to tune various EPC related parameters so that
				it can be used effectively for simulating any load balancing algorithms.

			<b> Khata Mobile Application | JS | React-Native | Team Work</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an android mobile application which can be used for maintaining daily balance logs. Users can credit or debit virtual money to each other by this application and the application will maintain all record which will be used accordingly when peers make transactions next time. In this project, the aim was to go through a complete software engineering process required for creating a software, invloving Requirements Gathering, SDS, Testing etc. I have done this project in a <a href = "https://github.com/abdul-manaan/Khata/graphs/contributors">team</a> with four other active contributors.

			<b> Half-Hulk Chrome Browser Extension | JS | Chrome API</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an extension for chrome browser which insures that other installed browser extensions are not causing any security or privacy related issues, like user's data stealing, while performing their network activities. It watches actions of other extensions in asynchronous mode and triggers a scan when any suspecious activity seems to occur. I developed it after motivation from a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/node/184486">research paper </a> published by UC Berkeley.
