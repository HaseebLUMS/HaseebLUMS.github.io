			<b> Research Assistant | Networks Security & Privacy Lab | Dr. Mobin Javed</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> I have worked as a research assistant on a Networks Security's project upon successfully winning LUMS' grant for Summer Research Project. My project aimed at automatically detecting and labeling Internet-of-Thing devices present in a network. I used the approach of Acquisitional Rule-based Engine and built a prototype which, without human effort, detects and reports device information of the IoTs present in a network.</p>

			<b> Khata Mobile Application | JS | React-Native | Team Work</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an android mobile application which can be used for maintaining daily balance logs. Users can credit or debit virtual money to each other by this application and the application will maintain all record which will be used accordingly when peers make transactions next time. In this project, the aim was to go through a complete software engineering process required for creating a software, invloving Requirements Gathering, SDS, Testing etc. I have done this project in a <a href = "https://github.com/abdul-manaan/Khata/graphs/contributors">team</a> with four other active contributors.

			<b> Half-Hulk Chrome Browser Extension | JS | Chrome API</b>
			<p style = "padding-left: 30px"> 
				I have made an extension for chrome browser which insures that other installed browser extensions are not causing any security or privacy related issues, like user's data stealing, while performing their network activities. It watches actions of other extensions in asynchronous mood and triggers a scan when any suspecious activity seems to occur. I developed it after motivation from a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/node/184486">research paper </a> published by UC Berkeley.
