			<b> Research Assistant | Networks Security & Privacy Lab | Dr. Mobin Javed</b>
			<p> I have worked as a research assistant on a Networks Security's project upon successfully winning LUMS' grant for Summer Research Project. My project aimed at automatically detecting and labeling Internet-of-Thing devices present in a network. I used the approach of Acquisitional Rule-based Engine and built a prototype which, without human effort, detects and reports device information of the IoTs present in a network.</p>
